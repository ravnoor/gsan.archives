### GSAN is holding FREE French classes! Classes are led by student volunteers from the IPN.


All levels offer grammar, conversation, vocabulary & exercises.

You don’t have to know your level to register, just give us an estimation of your knowledge. A placement test will be sent to all registered students to correctly asses your level.

Please note that we may modify the classes content & levels according to student’s needs and motivation.
