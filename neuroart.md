### Optogenetics: a brilliant tool for neuroscience
_By Kelly Bullock, MSc Student_

Optogenetics is a powerful tool for selectively controlling specific types of brain cells. Over the last 15 years, this technique has seen many advancements that improve our understanding of brain circuitry.

What does food and neuroscience have in common?  Here "Garlic versus dorsal root ganglion" shows the similarity between two things that are otherwise quite unrelated. Garlic and DRGs have a similar general shape but, more interestingly, when cut they are even more similar. They can both be organized in a vertical column (garlic weave and spinal cord).

Santiago Ramón y Cajal is considered by many to be the father of neuroscience. He is famous for illustrating the intricate arborisations of neurons - some of which are depicted in the background. Maria's drawing represents a realistic image of the legendary scientist based on old photographs.

### Neuro Novo

Immunostaining of two different isotypes of the cytoskeletal-associated protein DRR1 in a week-old cultured sample of human brain tissue, demonstrating differential localization of the two isoforms, and producing an image with a striking resemblance to a dying star. One isoform of DRR1 (stained in red) appears to be localized to the nuclei and cell bodies of cells, including the soma of neurons. DRR1 has been characterized as an important protein in the progression and development of brain cancer, and offers a promising avenue of research into understanding how brain cancer cells motility functions.
