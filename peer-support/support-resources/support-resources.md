[**Supervision Graduate and Postdoctoral Support**](http://www.mcgill.ca/ipn/continuing/conflict)

“Compared with undergraduate education, graduate education—and beyond—tends to involve long-term and either individual or small-group supervisory relationships that have a special and lasting influence on the careers and lives of supervisees and supervisors.
This website is for new and experienced graduate supervisors, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Its focus is guidance and practical advice. It was adapted through an agreement with the University of Oxford and Australian National University.”

[**Office of the Ombudsperson**](http://www.mcgill.ca/ombudsperson/meet)
“The Office of the Ombudsperson for students offers confidential, informal, independent, and impartial dispute resolution services to all members of the student community by providing information, advice, intervention and referrals.
The mandate of the Ombudsperson at McGill University is to intervene at the beginning of the complaint process, and to attempt to resolve issues informally before they proceed to more formal processes.
The Ombudsperson is an advocate for a fair process according to the mission of the University and not an advocate for the individual or for the administration. He works independently of University structures, considers all sides of a question as impartially and objectively as possible mindful of possible conflicts of interest. The Ombudsperson at McGill operates in an advisory capacity, and relies on the cooperation and good will of students, faculty, and the administration of the University community.”
