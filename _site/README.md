Jekyll-KickStart:
-------------------------
This project is very similar to the jekyll-bootstrap project, but takes a much
more minimalist approach to simply provide the scaffolding of a new Jekyll
website using Bootstrap CSS framework.  It is intended to be a starter project
where you then edit the _config.yml and then add new content and layouts.

I created this project because it is apparent that if you wish to use Jekyll +
Bootstrap, there is currently only a single project which aims to provide this
integration.  However, this project is really heavy and more confusing than it
needs to be if you simply want to start with a clean jekyll project with
Bootstrap integration.
