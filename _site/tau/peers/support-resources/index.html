“The Office of the Ombudsperson for students offers confidential, informal, independent, and impartial dispute resolution services to all members of the student community by providing information, advice, intervention and referrals.

The Ombudsperson is an advocate for a fair process according to the mission of the University and not an advocate for the individual or for the administration. He works independently of University structures, considers all sides of a question as impartially and objectively as possible mindful of possible conflicts of interest. The Ombudsperson at McGill operates in an advisory capacity, and relies on the cooperation and good will of students, faculty, and the administration of the University community.”</p>
