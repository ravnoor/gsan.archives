## Congratulations on your admission to McGill and welcome to the IPN!

We are the Graduate Student’s Association of Neuroscience (GSAN), an association that represents Neuroscience graduate and post-graduate students at McGill. Our goal is to promote the integration and participation of students in the department and to provide a platform for social and educational interactions between IPN students across all research institutes in Montreal.

In our welcome brochure (see below) we have compiled a few useful links and information that will hopefully help you with your new start in Montreal and McGill. Take a look at it and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions and comments!

You can contact the new and international student officer by e-mail: [newintl.gsan@gmail.com](mailto:newintl.gsan@gmail.com)
