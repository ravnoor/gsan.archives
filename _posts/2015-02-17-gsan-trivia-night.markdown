We will be holding our second annual trivia night on Wednesday March 11th at 7pm in the Thomson House basement lounge. The format will consist of four rounds of questions, with one round having a neuroscience theme. You can register as part of a team or as an individual.



Snacks and drinks will be provided and prizes will be awarded to the best and most creative teams!
