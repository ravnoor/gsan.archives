Dear new graduate students of the IPN,  
  
Congratulations on your admission to McGill and welcome to the IPN!   
We are the Graduate Student Association of Neuroscience (GSAN), an organization that represents graduate and post-graduate students enrolled in the IPN at McGill. Our goal is to promote a sense of community between students in the IPN and to provide a platform for social and educational interactions between students across all research institutes in Montreal.   
We have compiled a few useful links and information that will hopefully help you with your new start in at McGill and in Montreal. Take a look at it and please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions or comments!   
We are currently planning welcome & social events for all of you on Friday, September 5th. The events will be linked to a mandatory info session organized by the IPN administrators.
