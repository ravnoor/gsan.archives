Hello McGill Graduate Student Association for Neuroscience Members!




 




Exams are coming up, which means the first half of the school year is almost done!  2013 will bring a new year and a changing MCAT.  There is no more writing sample on the MCAT, making it shorter now than ever!  There is a new, _optional_ section at the end of the test.  If you elect to write this optional section on test day, the AAMC will give you a $30 Amazon gift card.  The details of these changes to the test and to our prep courses are outlined in the attached document.




 




I’d also like to let you know that you have until December 12th to take advantage of the maximum discount off of our courses starting in January!  If you enroll in a course at least one month before the course start date you will receive a $100 early enrollment discount.  You can combine this with your $200 student group discount by entering this promotion code at the checkout:  TORMTLNS$200.




 




Feel free to contact us at 1-888-876-5545 x.1207 if you have any questions!




 




Good luck on exams and Happy Holidays!




 




Sincerely,




 




-The Princeton Review Team
