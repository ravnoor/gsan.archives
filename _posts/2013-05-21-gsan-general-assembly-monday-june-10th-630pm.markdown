[![GAposter_spring2013](http://gsaneuro.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/gaposter_spring2013.png?w=225)](http://gsaneuro.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/gaposter_spring2013.png)It is time to elect a new GSAN executive committee! Our general assembly will take place on **Monday, June 10th at 6:30pm in deGrandpre Communications Center**. It is important that as many IPN students as possible attend and participate as GSAN represents IPN students, organizes academic and social events and participates in PGSS meetings.

We are also calling for nominations of students who wish to be part of the executive; that is President, VP Social, VP Academic, VP Finance and Operations and VP External. (N.B. Officer elections are held in the fall.)
