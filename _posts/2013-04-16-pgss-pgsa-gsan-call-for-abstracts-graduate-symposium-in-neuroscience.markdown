Hi IPN!




We are now accepting abstract submissions for GSAN’s Graduate Symposium in Neuroscience, which will take place **Wednesday, May 29****th** in the DeGrandpré Communications Centre at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Our event aims to showcase the tremendous research performed in the IPN and will consist of an afternoon filled with student presentations and scientific debate.




The abstract submission period will remain open until **11:59 PM on Wednesday, April 24****th****. **Abstracts should not exceed 300 words and must include a title and list of authors. Please also indicate your supervisor(s) in your message.




This year, IPN students will select the abstracts for presentation. Once the submission period has closed, students will vote for their favourite abstracts via survey. The students whose abstracts receive the highest number of votes will be invited to present their work as a 10-15 minute presentation.




All submissions should be sent as a word document to [gsan.mcgill@gmail.com](https://exchange.mcgill.ca/owa/redir.aspx?C=T56Raar03UOoJ7QIJWhu-WgunGDYDdAIJPbnO8kKEohXcfihhzrC9Ekz8UN5U_dDEC5PUNXtYIo.&URL=mailto%3agsan.mcgill%40gmail.com)




We look forward to reading your submissions!




Sincerely,




The GSAN Academic team
