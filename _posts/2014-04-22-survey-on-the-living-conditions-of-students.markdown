The deadline (**April 25, 2014**) is approaching to participate in the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ)  survey on living conditions of students. Your participation will allow for a real portrait of the situations faced by students in Quebec regarding, for example, their sources of funding, their incomes, their debt situation, and their studies-family balance. Participation will also give you a chance to win a **MacBook Air 13’’ **and an **Apple iPad**.
