GSAN will be starting FREE French classes in the coming weeks! Classes will be led by student volunteers from the IPN.





Location: Humanities & Social Sciences Library, Seminar room TBA. Time: 6:30 pm





3 levels will be offered:
1. Beginners (very little or no experience): Class will alternate between Mondays and Thursdays. Start: Thursday 27th of February.
2. Intermediate: Class will alternate between Tuesdays and Fridays. Start: Friday 28th of February.
3. Middle-advanced: Every Wednesday. Start: Wednesday 26th of February.





All levels will offer grammar, conversation, vocabulary & exercises.
You don’t have to know your level to register, just give us an estimation of your knowledge. A placement test will be sent to all registered students to correctly asses your level.
Please note that we may modify the classes content & levels according to student’s needs and motivation.
Thank you & special thanks to all the volunteer teachers for their time and enthusiasm!!
