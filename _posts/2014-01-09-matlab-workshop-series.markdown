Attention all IPN students,

·       Jan 27th, 7-8pm: Psychtoolbox





 





**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**





**Please download MATLAB prior to session 1, as well as the two toolboxes prior to sessions 2 and 3!**





You can request a free 30-day trial version of MATLAB here:

Also, if you would like to learn more about MATLAB prior to coming to the workshop and try a tutorial for yourself, you can download the book MATLAB for Neurosciences (2nd edition) for free from Science Direct through McGill. Part 1 (Fundamentals), chapters 1 and 2, provides a great overview of MATLAB with a tutorial for beginners.
