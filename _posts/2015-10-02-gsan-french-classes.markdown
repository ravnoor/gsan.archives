GSAN French classes will begin this month! These classes are completely free and will be taught by student volunteers from the IPN for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. All levels will cover grammar, conversation, vocabulary, and useful phrases for getting around Montreal. Classes will take place one day of the week from 5:30 - 7:00 pm in the MNI.
