**SERF on Optogenetics**
Date: October 30th, 7-8.30PM @ Thomson House (room 404)
Join this termâ€™s first SERF (student experimental research forum) to learn more about optogenetics, and discuss this technique with other students in a laid-back atmosphere. Round off the evening and stay for a few drinks at Thomson House afterwards.
