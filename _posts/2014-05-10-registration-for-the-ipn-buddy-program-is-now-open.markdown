Graduate students of all levels are invited to become **Senior Buddies** (including those who entered before or in January 2014)! If you were a new student this year or earlier, pay the favour forward and become a Senior Buddy!)

Your responsibilities as a Senior Buddy will be to introduce yourself to the new student buddied up with you (via e-mail) and be available to answer questions your Junior Buddy may have. To improve the experience of new students this year, we will ask Senior Buddies to contact their Junior Buddies no later than August 1st.

A perk to being a buddy (in addition to making new friends of course) is that **all Senior Buddies will be invited to the New Student Welcome Event **(to occur during the 1st week of September 2014)**!**

If you are interested in being a senior buddy, please register here by July 10th:
