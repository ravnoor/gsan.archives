The Olympics are now over, but a more elite competition is just around the corner!

![TriviaNight](http://gsaneuro.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/trivianight.png?w=271)

GSAN will be hosting its first ever TRIVIA NIGHT on Monday March 10th, 7pm at Thomson House in the basement lounge. Free beverages and snacks will be provided while you challenge friends and colleagues to see who will win the gold medal in trivia! The format will be similar to PGSS trivia (4 rounds), but one round will have a neuroscience theme.

There will be prizes for the best team, and the most creative team!
