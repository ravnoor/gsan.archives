Attention GSAN students...










This Wednesday, March 20th, PGSS (Post Graduate Students’ Society of McGill) is having its Annual General Meeting. ALL graduate students are invited to speak and vote on important motions concerning student finances and tuition, among other issues. 




In past years, GSAN students have been under-represented at this meeting, leading to decisions being made that may not reflect the views of those in our program. For example, at last year’s meeting the PGSS student body voted to support the province-wide student strike and to join the student protests over tuition hikes. However, it appeared that the strike and similar policy was initiated by a very vocal minority, comprised of students from only a few departments. 










Now is the chance to have your voice heard! You are encouraged to attend!










Meeting Location and Time: Thomson House Ballroom, 6:30PM - 9:30PM










Dinner is provided FREE for all attendees!

Motions that may be of interest to neuroscience students being put forward at the AGM include:




 




5.3 Motion regarding international student differential fee waivers (Meng Fu/Anne-Sophie Pratte)




-This motion calls for the restoration of fee waivers that were previously available to international graduate students, but have since been rescinded 




 




5.6 Motion to censure Academic Affairs Officer and Secretary-General (Fernanda Soler Urzúa/Gretchen King)




-This motion calls for the censure (official expression of strong disapproval) of two PGSS executives, for failing to ensure the completion of an audit of the private security firm which provides security on the McGill campus 




-Censure is often used in political organizations as a step toward suspension or expulsion




 




5.7 No indexation of tuition (External Affairs Officer/Gretchen King)




-This motion calls for PGSS to officially oppose the Quebec government’s plan to link tuition increases to the rate of inflation (about 3% per year), as well as “mobilization of McGill groups” to “demonstrate” against the government
