Dear IPN students,

Do you know about the student-aid resources available at McGill?

Would knowledge of the available resources be useful to you or someone you know?

We are looking for leaders to join the IPN Peer Support Team (PST).

The IPN PST is a joint initiative between members of GSAN, students enrolled in the IPN and the IPN department. Our aim is to provide support to students by directing them to the appropriate trained professionals.

Please read the attachment for a full description of the initiative as well as the requirements, roles and responsibilities of a peer support leader.

To join, please fill in the following link:
