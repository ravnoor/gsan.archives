Full details of our GSAN's Research Symposium in Neuroscience, to occur on Friday, May 23rd, 2014, can be found here: www.gsaneuro.com/academic/graduate-symposium-in-neuroscience/

**ABSTRACT SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:**

**Abstracts (minus title) must not exceed 250 words, and abstract titles must not exceed 12 words. Abstracts must include a list of authors with one primary author (i.e. the one submitting the abstract) in bold. Please also indicate your supervisor(s) by underlining their name(s).**

Abstracts should be submitted in one of two categories: (1) cellular/molecular OR (2) systems neuroscience. Please SPECIFY which categoy you want to present in. If your abstract contains content suitable for both categories, please submit to the category you feel is most appropriate.

All submissions should be sent as a word document to [**vpacademicgsan@gmail.com**](mailto:vpacademicgsan@gmail.com).

After the submission period has closed, all IPN students will be invited to vote for which abstracts they would most like to see presented. Names will be removed from the abstracts before the voting occurs. The top ranked abstracts will be selected for oral communications at the research symposium on Friday May 23rd, 2014 at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Presentations will be adjudicated by professors from the IPN department. A prize for the best presentation in each category will be awarded. There will be no poster presentations at this event.
