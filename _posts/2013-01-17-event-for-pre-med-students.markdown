We’ve organized an event for next week with two speakers – one about med school applications and one about the MCAT.  This would probably be of interest to your students, so if you could email the message below to your members, post it on your facebook page, and tweet it out, that would be great!  Please copy me on the message, or forward it to me just so that I know the message is going out J  Also, feel free to give me a call if you have any questions about the event!
