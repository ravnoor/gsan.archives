Dear New Students and IPN buddies,

To welcome you to the start of a new school year, weâ€™d like to invite you for a drink at the 3 Brasseurs (old port) on **Friday the 18th at 6:30 pm**!

GSAN will invite to your first beer/soft drink + snacks!

This is a great opportunity to meet up with your buddy and new fellow students in the program!

Please see the attached poster and **RSVP by Wednesday January 16th **by going to**: [http://tinyurl.com/cnfqusd](http://tinyurl.com/cnfqusd)**
