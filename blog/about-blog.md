### The GSANeuro Blog invites current GSAN members and alumni to share their thoughts, ideas, and stories about life at the lab and around the city! We also invite GSAN members to share newly published manuscripts.   

Past GSANeuro Blog topics have included experiences transitioning to graduate studies, surviving the cold Montreal winter, the McGill Opera, and interesting new research findings. You can view previous blogs at [http://gsaneuro.com/blog/](http://gsaneuro.com/blog/) .

### **Jonathan Côté**

<img align="left" src="https://gsaneuro.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/johnathancote1.jpg?w=225" alt="Jonathan" hspace="20"> Greetings all! I'm Jonathan, second year MSc student under Étienne de Villers-Sidani at the MNI. I am one of the rare Montréal-born-and-raised members of IPN. On the academic level, I'm interested in auditory functions and brain imaging. When I'm not at the lab, one can find me either jogging, learning martial arts, watching strange "exploitation films" or attending some sort of artsy venues.
Furthermore, I serve GSAN as an academic officer, a French teacher, a BrainReach teacher and a blogger and I am also an active member of the Red Runners club and the Brain Ballers volleyball team.
